# gitQAQ
A git host that only provide api, written in java using dropwizard

## Why another git host?

Though there are already many opensource self host git projects, like gitlab, phabricator, gogs, bitbucket. The comes up with too many things, issue tracker, ci etc. I like those integrated features, but they are just too complex to extend, and once you made some modification, it's hard to follow the update. 

## What does it provide

- a git host that support ssh & http
- prvoide restful api for spa applications
- integrate with common user systems
